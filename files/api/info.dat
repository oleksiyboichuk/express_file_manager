@AnandRaj: what do you mean with: how to validate "id"? What kind of validation do you want? BTW, you can get the value of id in your function like this: var sampleId = req.params.id;. –

Use req.params.whatever in latest versions. –

Mind that req.params is different from req.query! expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.params expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.query @adelriosantiago –

I don't believe this answer (from the OP) actually answers his own original question! He clearly asked how to access a querystring value IN COMBINATION WITH A POSITIONAL PARAMETER (:id). I have exactly the same issue, and this answer does NOT provide a solution ?! –

Use req.query, for getting he value in query string parameter in the route. Refer req.query. Say if in a route, http://localhost:3000/?name=satyam you want to get value for name parameter, then your 'Get' route handler will go like this :-

app.get('/', function(req, res){
    console.log(req.query.name);
    res.send('Response send to client::'+req.query.name);

});
